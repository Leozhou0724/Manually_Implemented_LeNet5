Type-A Project
It's a manually implemented LeNet-5 Neural Network for the MNIST dataset based on numpy
The MNIST dataset is already included in the floder which is the "mnist.pkl" file

All the layer class are written in the "layer.py" file and 
the LeNet-5 model is in the "LeNet.py" file

Run the "LeNet.py" to run the training program, 
it's very very slow in my laptopm, so I just run 
the training process for a while and watch the loss, details in the "Result.txt" file
